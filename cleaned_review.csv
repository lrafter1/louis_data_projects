The only tool I had available was a hacksaw blade, so this took a lot longer than expected. Only other complaint is that the seat attachment design and hardware seemed cheap compared to other seats I have installed (replacement seats). Overall, the toilet flushes great, installs according to typical instructions, and everything else went smoothly. The flush mechanism, handle, flap, and standpipe came preinstalled in the tank, with no issues or leaks. The toilet does NOT come with a hose to connect the tank to the wall water supply, as this is specific to each house, but make sure to note that if you are replacing a shorter bowl height toilet with this one, your existing supply line will likely be too short. You should replace it anyway. Overall this seems like a great replacement and includes a lot of value and convenience as a complete kit.",5,13,2,instal went mostli accord plan howev bolt secur toilet floor long cut tool avail hacksaw blade took lot longer expect complaint seat attach design hardwar seem cheap compar seat instal replac seat overal toilet flush great instal accord typic instruct everyth els went smoothli flush mechan handl flap standpip came preinstal tank issu leak toilet come hose connect tank wall water suppli specif hous make sure note replac shorter bowl height toilet one exist suppli line like short replac anyway overal seem like great replac includ lot valu conveni complet kit

Scared me the first time I flushed it. It comes with easy to install instructions which is a plus, all the hardware you need to install the toilet minus your water supply line comes in the box. I do not care for the toilet seat that accompanies this system. I feel that the seat is cheap and the hole in which you use is too small. I am not a large person and it still feels uncomfortable, and the screws that come with it to install the seat are extremely long, could definitely use shorter screws and metal not plastic would be nice. Also when installing the tank to the base, you might want to have a 17mm socket available to help tighten down the bowl. Once the toilet is in place, you only have a few inches from the wall to try and secure the screws provided. I used a 17mm socket to help secure the nuts to the bolts.

We chose the round bowl because of our limited space between the toilet and the vanity. This new toilet fits our small space and looks very good. The package included everything needed for a complete installation except the line from the water supply to the tank inlet. They really could not include that line because I needed to measure the distance to buy the correct line length. Everything was packaged compactly in an single box with lifting handles on the sides. An inner box contains the tank, tank cover, and instructions. I didn't notice that the cover was packed below the tank until after removing the tank from the box. The instructions were clear, and the installation was reasonable. It was easy to set the toilet square and level, and there were no leaks after following the instructions. Before trying this toilet, I had some general concern about the effectiveness of the low-flow operation, but this toilet appears to have a powerful flush. The tank is almost as large as the one on the old high-flow toilet, but the mechanism appears to meter less than half of the tank capacity for each flush. The weight of the remaining water provides more force for the limited water that is delivered in a flush. Each flush appears to clear the bowl completely, and we have not had any problems with it. This bowl height of this toilet is higher than the one that we replaced. Our consensus is that this height is more comfortable than the lower bowl, but I expect that is a matter of personal preference. This provided a good solution for our particular renovation need.

As long as it flushes with power and stuff goes down the drain without clogging it has done its job. However, not all toilet installs are created equal. I bought the toilet because its made in US and I figured it would be great quality. I didn’t check the reviews and I should have. This toilet has some QC issues and some included hardware is shoddy. The bolts holding down the tank were rubber pegs. It seemed ok at first but even tightened down they leaked. Also the holes between the base and the tank for the pegs were not alligned perfectly contributing to the leaking. I ended up installing the tank twice. The second time I put some wax from a left over wax ring around the peg and seated it in tank to water proof it. This resolved the leaking during the install. The second shoddy piece is the seat. Again the bolts didnt properly align with the holes in the base so I am not sure how long it will take before the hinges crack. Once installed the toilet does toilet things as you would expect.

So, I started doing some research to replace it. Mansfield Summit was the solution. Installation was standard and the flush was exactly what was expected; one flush for solids. My parents are very pleased. Cons, the seat that comes with it is poorly constructed, a disappointment. You will need to replace it. I’m not kidding, it’s that bad.

But it's turned out to be the most problematic toilet I've ever installed. I've probably installed around 20 over the last 20 years. The handle on the first one had a defect that caused the handle to stick and hold the flapper open. I had to lift the handle back up to make it close. I got another toilet and the handle worked fine. The donut that goes between the tank and the bowl is made of stiffer rubber than any other toilet I've installed. This stiffness appears to have caused the donut to leak. I purchased an after market donut that was squishy like normal and the leaks stopped. The tank bolts are a weird design. The seal is integral to the bolt. One out of three of these bolts kept leaking on me. I switched to the standard design with separate bolt and washer and it was fine.

I am *generally* happy with my purchase, but there were a few things that posed an issue. First, the bolts that hold the toilet tank to the bowl; these are not washers and bolts that used to be standard (but seem to be with repair kits; go figure), but rather a bolt with a rubber head. I had difficulty with two of three bolts, in that they leaked. I had to loosen, reset, tighten and really torque the bolts down, to the point I was afraid I would crack the porcelain. I don't know why this was changed from the old rubber washer with separate bolt; I've never had any issues with that style leaking in the past. Second, the fill valve, although a Fluidmaster and a reputable brand, ""popped"" on the second day after install. I heard a horrific noise, and went to the bathroom to see what had happened. I thought a pipe had burst, only to find that the toilet water was now running. Lifting the lid, I found that the noise was caused by the top of the fill valve giving way, and hitting the toilet tank cover, which was now continually filling. Apparently a ""lesser quality"" fill valve was included, and I had to purchase another, adding $20 to the original cost of the toilet. Third, the flapper included is horrible. The bottom is made of plastic, not rubber, and consequently, when the flap closes, it makes a LOUD slapping sound. This too had to be replaced along with the fill valve, included in the Fluidmaster Repair Kit that I had to purchase. Why have a ""silent close"" lid, when the sound of the flapper closing is about a loud as a toilet seat dropping? Makes no sense. I imagine that ""cheaper"" lower quality fill valves come with the toilet. Please, either supply quality kits with the toilet and raise the price, or just don't supply them at all, and lower the price of the toilet. While it's been quite a few years since I had to purchase a new toilet, I realize that they are now made to conserve water, but what is the point if you have to flush the toilet three times in order to have a completely empty toilet? In general, it's a toilet. Personally, I'm not into the ""design"" as I am with the function. While it was convenient to have everything supplied for installation, it's still aggravating to have to go back to the store to replace an inferior quality fill valve and flap. The water conservation feature is something I will have to live with since this seems to be the standard now.

Bought 2 for house with 3 toilets, wife primarily uses 2 of them so I wanted them to be the same so she wouldn't flop onto the shorter one. It is tall. You can read the other comments, I agree with them. So let me offer these suggestions. It is 95 pounds. I bought online so someone would deliver it to my car at Lowe's. At home, I opened the box in the driveway and carried it in two pieces rather than trying to lug a 95 pound box myself.The bottom is still heavy, hard on the back. New appreciation for plumbers. Regarding the flange bolts being too long, that is correct they need to be cut. After removing my current toilet and cleaning the area, I noticed those bolts were cut when installed originally in 1992. I reused them, no need to cut the ones that came with the toilet. The instructions talked about the waterline in the tank, which is not on the inside of the tank but on the white tube in the middle of the tank. Instructions say don't use galvanized hoses--they are not talking about the newer braided metal hoses, those are ok to use. If you don't crank the tank down, water will go all over when you flush, it is a bit different to use a socket on those 3 plastic nuts that hold the tank in place. Allow extra time for removal of the old one and cleaning up the area before the new installation. Removing the old one is just the reverse steps you will follow for the new installation, except you have to scoop out the water. In my case, the footprint of the old toilet was bigger than the new one, and I had to do some quick floor sanding and staining, sealing in two small places. I lined the area with paper towels to spot leaks for 3 days. Scraper tool helpful for old wax removal.

This one was no exception, what should have been a two hour project took almost three times as long. First remove the old toilet only to find the flange is destroyed and will take ingenuity and lots of work. Many hours later I have the new flange and wax ring (provided with this toilet) in place ready for installation. This toilet bolted in very easily but I had to use plastic connector bolt different from the ones provided. These were recommended by a plumber when I was addressing the broken flange issue. I went to connect the toilet to the water supply but alas they did not provide that water line. Trying to reuse the old one it broke because part of it was plastic. It took three trips to Lowe’s to get the correct new shut-off valve and water fill line. Mostly my fault for not trying the connection at the store. The best part of this whole installation was the toilet itself, in the past I would have had to install the guts of the toilet myself adding time and expense. While this is only the third toilet I have ever installed it was by far the easiest. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to install a new toilet. I did spend a bit of time hunting for the plastic bolts for the seat, and finally decided to use the old ones figuring that they were not shipped or that I had misplaced them.

The original toilet was 38 years old and a high-water-use type toilet. I had previously installed three other toilets in other bathrooms in the house. This toilet was the easiest to install, but that is largely because there weren't any issues with the flange or flooring flatness (no shims required) like in the other rooms. The kit contained everything I needed. Sometimes if things aren't so square, you'll need shims to level the toilet and possibly a problem-solver seal, rather than the supplied wax ring. The only non-obvious part of the install was the plastic rings that hold the plastic dome caps that cover the mounting bolts for the bottom portion of the toilet. I had to put on my glasses to see that they are marked with ""this side up"" text. As a tip, I used some tools on the floor as guides as to where the flange bolts were as I lowered the base down onto the flange seal. I have included a photos of what I'm speaking of for clarity. The longest part of the install was cleaning around the area, which is typical in my experience. The flush works well, but not quite as powerful as a toilet costing three times as much. For the pool room, this will be just fine.",5,7,0,instal new toilet pool room origin toilet year old type toilet previous instal three toilet bathroom hous toilet easiest instal larg issu flang floor flat shim requir like room kit contain everyth need sometim thing squar need shim level toilet possibl seal rather suppli wax ring part instal plastic ring hold plastic dome cap cover mount bolt bottom portion toilet put glass see mark side text tip use tool floor guid flang bolt lower base onto flang seal includ photo speak clariti longest part instal clean around area typic experi flush work well quit power toilet cost three time much pool room fine

Instructions were simple and the rubber-headed tank bolts create a great seal. That said, a few things to keep in mind: 1. Buy an extra wax ring. If you’ve had a remodel that includes granite or marble flooring, odds are good the supplied ring won’t be thick enough to create a good seal. Having a second ring will allow you to double the depth. Wax rings run about $2.00, so go ahead and splurge—it could save you a trip back to the store; 2. When attaching the tank, you’ll need to stretch the rubber gasket a bit to seat it flush to the bottom of the tank. The instructions are a bit vague on that, and you’ll be going through a couple of towels if you don’t! The toilet itself is pretty good. The oblong shape is far more comfortable than traditional round bowls. A quick flick of the handle drains about half the tank (thereby conserving water) and holding the handle down will completely drain it (for when a little more oomph is needed). What I like best is that the tank is very quiet when refilling.

That's what I need it to do and it does it well. Waste goes away when I hit flush...that's a win. For install, it went smoothly. Removed the old toilet, cleaned the old wax off the flange, then began installing the new toilet. I only have one criticism...the hardware kit that comes with the toilet doesn't have the nice little plastic washers to help hold the flange bolts up while you install the bowl. You can see in pic #3 where I used small pieces of cardboard to hold the bolts up. It works, but it wouldn't be too much to ask for Mansfield to include simple, cheap, thin plastic washers to hold the bolts up. Other than that, install was smooth. Got the bowl installed then put the tank on the back. After that, I connected the water feed, turned on the water, and checked for leaks...there were none!

The toilet has a large jet at the bottom that helps push waste to the drain (see photo). THE NEUTRAL: The flapper has a unique design as the hole on one side is larger than the hole on the other side. Not a big deal as Lowe's sells the Mansfield flapper (item # 4133941). If you care to upgrade to a better flapper, you will greatly increase your flush performance (Lowe's item # 4133941), see photo. The Fluid Master fill valve comes with a flow restrictor which means that it takes a long time to refill the tank after each flush. Instructions for removing the flow restrictor can be found my Googling ""How to remove the toilet fill valve regulator."" COULD BE BETTER: There are no rubber washers or spacers used to level & support the tank as you secure it to the toilet. After failing to get a good seal, I placed 3 tank toilet washers on top of each of the 3 holes on the toilet, then I placed the tank on the toilet (see photo). The Lowe's item # on the tank washers is 3625389. The tank was immediately level and stable, and the seal was perfect. Overall the Mansfield toilet is a quality product at a good price. If you add the rubber tank washers as spacers, you don't have to worry about porcelain to porcelain contact as the tank to toilet washer is compressed by the weight of the water in the tank.

While installation was easy and everything fit with no leaks, I am very disappointed with the performance. You have to flush at least twice to flush the bowl. A huge waste of water. Claims to be a water saver but if you have to flush multiple times, does not save water. At least it was in stock, installed easily and most important does not leak. Will work until she can get ones that flush better.",3,5,1,purchas new toilet daughter due young child need standard height one low stock stack toilet other taller chair height low consid famili young child instal easi everyth fit leak disappoint perform flush least twice flush bowl huge wast water claim water saver flush multipl time save water least stock instal easili import leak work get one flush better

The toilet seat is a cheap version and probably won't last very long. The other reason is the toilet isn't tall enough. I think the tall version is 17 inches high (Not sure of that).

Based on the item I had, I cannot recommend this product. I will caveat this with the fact that I only tested one and it very well could haver been faulty. So check other reviews also to see if others had the same problems. First thing I noticed was a lot of powder that came off of the toilet, so you will want to wipe it off well before bringing it into the house. The porcelain mold also left something to be desired. The instructions were fairly straight forward with diagrams. To test this toilet, I placed it on a level surface, hooked it up to a garden hose, and hooked that up to a standard supply line. The hose water pressure was the same as the interior of the house. The first real issue was with the bowl gasket. It had a grove that should be able to go over a lip on the bowl, but there was no lip. Even with heavy tightening of the bolts, the gasket would not sit right (see photo 1). I even tried to seat it onto the bowl first and it still would not seat well (photo 2). The fill valve was way off from the proper adjustment. The water kept flowing. It took a lot of turns to get the water to the right level. I would have expected the fill valve to at least be close to the right setting. After I set the water level, I added a blue dye so I could see how well the water circulated in the bowl during a flush (Photo 3). It actually did quite well in covering all sides of the bowl (Photo 4). The last issue I had was with the flapper. Most flappers will open up and remain open until the tank is fairly empty. On this tank, I had to hold the handle down during the entire flush in order to empty the tank. Pressing and releasing a second or two resulted in half the tank not emptying (photo 5). This flapper could not go back because the fill tube was in the way (photo 6). Bad design? I try to give every product I test the benefit of the doubt, but unfortunately, if this particular unit is typical of the bulk of the toilets, I just cannot recommend it.",2,11,2,furnish product conduct test provid review base item recommend product caveat fact test one well could haver faulti check review also see other problem first thing notic lot powder came toilet want wipe well bring hous porcelain mold also left someth desir instruct fairli straight forward diagram test toilet place level surfac hook garden hose hook standard suppli line hose water pressur interior hous first real issu bowl gasket grove abl go lip bowl lip even heavi tighten bolt gasket would sit right see photo even tri seat onto bowl first still would seat well photo fill valv way proper adjust water kept flow took lot turn get water right level would expect fill valv least close right set water level ad blue dye could see well water circul bowl flush photo actual quit well cover side bowl photo last issu flapper open remain open tank fairli empti tank hold handl entir flush order empti tank press releas second two result half tank empti photo flapper could go back fill tube way photo bad design tri give everi product test benefit doubt unfortun particular unit typic bulk toilet recommend

I did like that there is notches to rest against the tank once it is tightened down, making the tank feel more secure. I previously had installed an Danco perfect seal on the floor flange, Item #3844101. This is also the third time I have seated a toilet on this flange so I highly recommend picking up one. They are under all my toilets and make repairs and reinstalls so much easier then having to use a new wax ring. Once the toilet is installed, using wood shims to level, I slide a few paper straps under the toilet and flush repeated to check the seal. After 10 flushes, no water on paper, and I finish the install. The best part is our parents are now happier when they come to visit cause there is a taller toilet in the house.",5,7,0,parent tell u get taller toilet much nicer well sinc opportun get toilet made sure get taller one least make parent happier visit assembl super easi mayb caus rebuilt replac sever toilet alreadi like notch rest tank tighten make tank feel secur previous instal danco perfect seal floor flang item also third time seat toilet flang highli recommend pick one toilet make repair reinstal much easier use new wax ring toilet instal use wood shim level slide paper strap toilet flush repeat check seal flush water paper finish instal best part parent happier come visit caus taller toilet hous

Has a sleek design that elevates the look of the bathroom. Install is simple and comes with all the parts you need. The slow close lid is nice that it’s not loud when shut. I have a couple kids and am constantly asking them not to slam the lid. Nice that it’s not possible now. That said the lid (not the seat) is a little flimsy and I’m not able to sit on it without it bending in. I don’t think it’ll break but I also won’t be testing it. I also found the water refilling noise to be quite loud. I did turn the water down from fully open and that did eliminate it. Good to note if you have higher home water pressure. Other then that it’s been working great. If you’re looking to update the look of an older bathroom this could be a good fit.,4,5,0,toilet look nice sleek design elev look bathroom instal simpl come part need slow close lid nice loud shut coupl kid constantli ask slam lid nice possibl said lid seat littl flimsi abl sit without bend think break also test also found water refil nois quit loud turn water fulli open elimin good note higher home water pressur work great look updat look older bathroom could good fit

Next the toilet tank and lid are in their own box setting on the upside down bowl , the face of the bowl rests on about 1 3/8"" of cardboard. The weight of the bowl is impressively heavy, so it should stand up to heavy use by a family. The tank assembly has some very well designed components inside including the 3"" flapper assembly . The handle is all metal and should be strong enough to last. The unit comes complete with all mounting hardware and the soft close seat which is made from a long lasting polymer, easy to clean , with a finish that will not degrade.

I removed all the old wax ring, used my Simple Green to clean the floor and followed the simple instructions. I did adjust the tank level to a lower setting. This is a fast flush unit that will give you two flush cycles on one tank of water.

Also the tank bolt holes do not line up 100% to the bowel which caused the bolts to be installed on a slight angle which (on the first installation attempt) cause all three bolts to leak. After adding marine silicone to the bolt seals the bolt sealed fine but after filling the tank I found the tank (was cracked which was not cracked during installation).

First, the flapper falls way too fast, forcing you to hold the handle down for the flush duration. I have tried adjusting the foam float and the chain, but no matter what, if you push the handle and let it go, the flapper immediately falls and shuts. The instructions provide NO guidance on how to tune the flush. Second, the seat it comes with is garbage. If you stand to urinate, the seat falls down while you are going. Luckily, it's a slow fall, so you can catch it midstream, if you are quick! That or it slowing falls through the stream, rather than quickly passing through! Third, the flush is weak. Even holding the handle down the whole time, it is poor. No comparison to the American Standard (made in Thailand unfortunately) we have in the other bathroom. Pass on this toilet!!!

I called and spoke with them twice while deciding on purchasing this and they were very helpful. It's pretty (no logos on it anywhere, my wife likes handle on the side) and is solidly built/heavy. The flush is very strong when you hold the handle down (see dislikes) and it has anti-stick coating like other higher-end brand toilets. I chose it over similar American Standard (Champion) and Kohler (Cimmaron) toilets available at Lowes because these toilets have serious quality control issues (cracking and issues with flush valves, respectively). I did NOT use the included wax ring but instead used the Danco 4.75-in Toilet Wax Ring with Bolts Item #: 3844101 Model #: 10826X which I highly recommend as this allows you to reposition toilet if needed and it's a very secure fit on this toilet. Dislikes: You must hold the handle down to get a good flush. I talked to Mansfield about this and it's the way it's designed. The flapper they have doesn't float at all. I have purchased a new flapper to try from HomeDepot (Fluidmaster Universal 3 in. Premium Adjustable Toilet Flapper) that I'm hoping will allow for a good flush without holding the handle down. The flush is loud and the flapper slams down hard if you don't hold the handle down long enough. Also, it takes a long time for the tank to fill after flushing and it's louder than our previous toilet-most of the water goes into the bowl and not the tank. My wife feels the toilet sits a little high, but I'm fine with it-we're the same height so personal preference. Overall I'm pretty happy with the toilet and was VERY impressed with Mansfield's customer service. I had a hard time finding any information about this toilet before I bought, so I'm hoping this review helps other people decide on it.",4,1,1,like mansfield custom servic awesom call spoke twice decid purchas help pretti logo anywher wife like handl side solidli flush strong hold handl see dislik coat like brand toilet chose similar american standard champion kohler cimmaron toilet avail low toilet seriou qualiti control issu crack issu flush valv respect use includ wax ring instead use danco toilet wax ring bolt item model highli recommend allow reposit toilet need secur fit toilet dislik must hold handl get good flush talk mansfield way design flapper float purchas new flapper tri homedepot fluidmast univers premium adjust toilet flapper hope allow good flush without hold handl flush loud flapper slam hard hold handl long enough also take long time tank fill flush louder previou water go bowl tank wife feel toilet sit littl high fine height person prefer overal pretti happi toilet impress mansfield custom servic hard time find inform toilet bought hope review help peopl decid
